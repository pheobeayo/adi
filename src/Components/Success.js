              Hmmm… The exact time when I thought everything was over for me that was when I met the ADI team awareness on portfolio 9 community platform ,I decided to join.
              My first class with Them, my private chat with auntie ...her kind loving words and the first video call with me gives me strong hope that Jehovah God has sent an angel to be there for me cuz most people around me neglected me at that very moment of strong storm
              When the second wave hit early last month I was able to scale through because of the various teaching from this great group
              thank you auntie.
